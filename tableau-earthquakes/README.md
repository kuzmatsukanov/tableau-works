# Earthquake Data Dashboard

## Overview

This interactive dashboard is designed to visualize and explore earthquake data for Israel. It provides several key visualizations to help users gain insights into earthquake frequency, magnitude distribution, and potential correlations between earthquake depth and magnitude.

Users can use the date filter to select specific earthquake magnitude ranges for analysis.

## Visualizations

- Map Visualization
- Time Series Plot
- Magnitude Distribution
- Depth vs. Magnitude Scatter Plot

## Data Source

The earthquake data used in this dashboard is sourced from [USGS earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov). The data fetching and preprocessing are implemented in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/kuzmatsukanov/tableau-works/blob/main/tableau-earthquakes/usgs_extract.ipynb).
